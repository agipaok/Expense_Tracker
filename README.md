# 💰 Expense Tracker (Python Project)

## 📖 Description
A small Python app that helps you keep track of your daily expenses right from the terminal.  
You can add expenses, view them whenever you want, and see quick stats like the total amount spent, the average, and which one cost you the most.  

This was one of my first Python projects and helped me practice:
- handling user input and errors  
- using lists and tuples to store data  
- doing basic calculations  
- building a simple menu with loops

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Add a new expense (description + amount)  
✅ Display all saved expenses  
✅ Show statistics (total, average, and highest expense)  
✅ Input validation for numeric and positive values  
✅ Simple text-based interface

## 🚀 Ideas for Future Versions
- Save data to a file so it doesn’t reset every time  
- Add categories (Food, Rent, Travel, etc.)  
- Export to CSV  
- Better formatting and colors for the output
